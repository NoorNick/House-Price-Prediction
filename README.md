# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, lot size, and location. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset from Kaggle. This project was made in fulfillment for the Skills Union Data Science and AI Certification.

## Dataset

The dataset is available on Kaggle:  
👉 [House Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafarali27/house-price-prediction-dataset)

To use the dataset:
1. Create an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) if you don't have one.
2. Navigate to the dataset page linked above.
3. Download the CSV file(s) and place them into a folder named `data/` inside the project directory.
